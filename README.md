# Space Missions Analysis
This Vizualization project is about space missions which performed from 1975 - 2022 in multiple places across the world. 
I have analysed the dataset with using below recommended analysis Points: 

* How have rocket launches trended across time? Has mission success rate increased?
* Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has it always been that way?
* Which rocket has been used for the most space missions? Is it still active?
* Are there any patterns you can notice with the launch locations?
